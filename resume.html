    Futura was designed by Paul Renner in 1927 and was created 
    as a contribution to the New Frankfurt project. The design 
    is based on the simple geometries that became representative 
    of the Bauhaus style. Renner was not part of Bauhaus but he 
    shared their beliefs regarding fonts as expressions of modernity.
    Renner rejected the font styles of the past, the grotesques, 
    their narrowness and lack of a consistent system to their 
    weights and shape forms. The design of Futura helped usher 
    in a new Modern age and was emblematic of the era.
